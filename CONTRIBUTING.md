# Contribution Guidelines
We believe in making web3 a space for everyone. In an effort to create a bridge between web2 and web3, we've started this repository to collect resources. Because we believe it's a place for everyone, we're opening this repository for contributions from anyone. With that being states, we have some guidelines.

## BEFORE YOU SUBMIT
Determine if your submission is relevant by comparing it to the established list and the descriptions.
Be sure your submission hasnâ€™t previously been entered. You can do this by searching through previous submissions.
If you use this list or a resource from this list on your site or repo, please link back to us.
Determine what category it falls into.

## WHEN YOU SUBMIT
* Capitalize titles.
* List alphabetically for searchability.
* Proof read your entry
